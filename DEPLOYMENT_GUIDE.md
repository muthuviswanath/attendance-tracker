# Attendance Tracker - GoDaddy Hosting Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your Flask Attendance Tracker application to GoDaddy hosting using GitHub integration.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### 1. **GoDaddy Hosting Limitations**
- **Shared Hosting**: Limited Python library support, especially for computer vision libraries
- **VPS/Dedicated**: Full control but requires server management
- **Managed WordPress**: Not suitable for Flask applications

### 2. **Face Recognition Dependencies**
Your app uses:
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Face recognition libraries

These may not be available on shared hosting due to:
- Binary dependencies
- System-level requirements
- Memory/CPU intensive operations

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: GoDaddy VPS/Dedicated Hosting (Recommended)
**Best for**: Full functionality including face recognition
**Cost**: Higher but more flexible

### Option 2: Alternative Cloud Hosting (Highly Recommended)
**Platforms**: Heroku, PythonAnywhere, DigitalOcean, AWS
**Benefits**: Better Python support, easier deployment

### Option 3: GoDaddy Shared Hosting (Limited)
**Limitations**: May need to disable face recognition features
**Cost**: Lower but functionality limited

## üìã Pre-Deployment Preparation

### 1. Create Production Configuration
### 2. Set up GitHub Repository
### 3. Prepare Database Migration
### 4. Configure Environment Variables
### 5. Test Deployment Locally

## üîß Files to Modify for Production

### 1. **app.py** - Production settings
### 2. **requirements.txt** - Production dependencies
### 3. **wsgi.py** - WSGI entry point
### 4. **.htaccess** - URL rewriting (if needed)
### 5. **config.py** - Environment-specific settings

## üìù Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Application
1. Create production configuration
2. Update database settings
3. Configure file upload paths
4. Set up logging

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Initialize Git repository
2. Create .gitignore file
3. Commit and push code
4. Set up GitHub Actions (optional)

### Step 3: GoDaddy Deployment
1. Access cPanel/File Manager
2. Upload files or clone from GitHub
3. Configure Python environment
4. Set up database
5. Configure domain/subdomain

### Step 4: Database Migration
1. Export current SQLite database
2. Import to production database
3. Update connection strings
4. Test database connectivity

### Step 5: Testing and Monitoring
1. Test all functionality
2. Set up logging
3. Monitor performance
4. Configure backups

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Hosting Recommendations

### 1. **Heroku** (Easiest)
- Free tier available
- Git-based deployment
- Add-ons for databases
- Good Python support

### 2. **PythonAnywhere**
- Python-focused hosting
- Free tier available
- Easy Flask deployment
- Good for beginners

### 3. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- Affordable
- GitHub integration
- Managed databases
- Scalable

### 4. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Enterprise-grade
- Auto-scaling
- Integrated services
- Learning curve

## üéØ Recommended Approach

Given your application's complexity and dependencies, I recommend:

1. **First**: Try PythonAnywhere or Heroku for easier deployment
2. **Second**: GoDaddy VPS if you prefer staying with GoDaddy
3. **Last Resort**: GoDaddy shared hosting with limited features

## üìÅ What's Next?

I can help you with:
1. Creating production-ready configuration files
2. Setting up GitHub repository with proper structure
3. Modifying the application for your chosen hosting platform
4. Creating deployment scripts and documentation

Would you like me to proceed with preparing your application for a specific hosting option?
