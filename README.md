- Attendance settings (marking methods, validation rules)
- Batch settings (default attendance requirements)
- User management settings
- Database backup and maintenance settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Face Recognition Not Working**
   - Ensure webcam is connected and working
   - Check camera permissions in browser
   - Verify student photos are clear and front-facing
   - Check face recognition is enabled in settings

2. **Login Issues**
   - Ensure you have created at least one admin user
   - Check username/password combination
   - Verify session timeout settings

3. **Database Issues**
   - Check database file permissions
   - Verify database file exists and is not corrupted
   - Try database backup/restore if needed

4. **Upload Issues**
   - Check file size limits (16MB default)
   - Verify supported file formats (JPG, PNG)
   - Ensure upload folder has write permissions

5. **Performance Issues**
   - Check system resources (CPU, memory)
   - Clean up old log files
   - Consider database optimization for large datasets

### Face Recognition Tips
- Use good quality webcam (720p or higher)
- Ensure adequate lighting conditions
- Process one student at a time for best results
- Update student photos if recognition accuracy decreases
- Clean lens regularly for clear image capture

### System Maintenance
- Regularly backup database
- Monitor log files for errors
- Clean up old attendance records periodically
- Update student photos when appearance changes significantly

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Follow the existing Flask route patterns in `app.py`
2. Use direct SQL queries for database operations
3. Maintain Bootstrap 5 styling consistency
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Update this README with new functionality

### Database Management
- The application automatically creates tables on first run
- For schema changes, modify the `init_db()` function
- Use the migration system for data preservation
- Regular backups are recommended

### Code Structure
- **app.py**: Main application file with all routes and logic
- **config.py**: Configuration management
- **templates/**: Jinja2 HTML templates
- **static/**: Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **logs/**: Application logs
- **backups/**: Database backups

### Testing
- Test all attendance marking methods
- Verify face recognition accuracy with different lighting
- Test bulk upload functionality with sample data
- Validate user authentication and role permissions

## Security Considerations

- **User Authentication**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms
- **File Upload Security**: Uploaded files are validated and sanitized
- **Data Storage**: Student photos and face encodings stored locally
- **Session Management**: Configurable session timeout for security
- **Database Security**: SQLite database with proper file permissions
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all system activities

## Deployment

### Production Deployment
1. Set up a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)
2. Configure reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx)
3. Set up SSL/TLS certificates
4. Configure environment variables for production
5. Set up regular database backups
6. Monitor system logs and performance

### WSGI Configuration
The project includes `wsgi.py` for production deployment:
```python
from app import app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Docker Deployment (Optional)
Consider containerizing the application for easier deployment and scaling.
