## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for webcam handling
- **Face Recognition**: face_recognition library
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **File Handling**: Werkzeug for secure uploads

## Database Schema

### Students Table
- ID, Student ID, Name, Email
- Photo path and face encoding (binary)
- Creation timestamp

### Courses Table
- ID, Course Code, Course Name
- Instructor, Schedule
- Creation timestamp

### Enrollments Table
- Student ID, Course ID (foreign keys)
- Enrollment timestamp

### Attendance Table
- Student ID, Course ID (foreign keys)
- Date, Time, Status
- Creation timestamp

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Home page
- `GET /students` - View students
- `POST /add_student` - Add new student
- `GET /courses` - View courses
- `POST /add_course` - Add new course
- `GET /enroll` - Enrollment management
- `POST /enroll` - Create enrollment
- `POST /mark_attendance` - Select course for attendance
- `GET /webcam_attendance/<course_id>` - Webcam interface
- `POST /process_frame` - Process webcam frame for recognition
- `GET /reports` - Reports dashboard

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for sessions
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: Database connection string

### File Upload Settings
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG
- Storage location: `static/student_photos/`
- Automatic face encoding generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Check camera permissions in browser
   - Ensure camera is not used by other applications
   - Try different browsers (Chrome recommended)

2. **Face recognition not accurate**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Use clear, front-facing photos
   - Retake photos if recognition fails

3. **Installation issues**
   - Install Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows)
   - Install cmake and dlib dependencies
   - Use conda environment if pip fails

### Performance Tips
- Use good quality webcam (720p or higher)
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Process one student at a time for best results
- Regularly clean up old attendance records

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Follow the existing Flask route patterns
2. Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
3. Maintain Bootstrap styling consistency
4. Add proper error handling
5. Update this README

### Database Migrations
The application automatically creates tables on first run. For schema changes:
1. Modify models in `app.py`
2. Delete `attendance.db` file
3. Restart application to recreate tables

## Security Considerations

- Student photos are stored locally
- Face encodings are stored securely in database
- File uploads are validated and sanitized
- Session management for web interface
- No external API dependencies for face recognition

## License

This project is for educational and internal use. Please ensure compliance with privacy regulations when handling student data.
